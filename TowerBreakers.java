Problem Statement: Tower Breakers Game
Two players are playing a game of Tower Breakers. Player 1 always moves first, and both players play optimally. The rules of the game are as follows:

Initially, there are n towers, and each tower has a height of m.
On each player's turn, they can choose any tower of height x (where x > 1) and reduce its height to y, where 1 â‰¤ y < x and x % y == 0 (i.e., the new height must be a divisor of the current height).
Players alternate turns, and the first player who cannot make a move loses the game.
Given the number of towers and their initial height, determine which player will win the game. If Player 1 wins, return 1. Otherwise, return 2.

For each test case, return 1 if Player 1 wins or 2 if Player 2 wins.

Constraints:
Both players play optimally.
The number of towers n is always greater than or equal to 1.
The height of each tower m is always greater than or equal to 1.
